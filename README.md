ASBA
====

ASBA refers to "adaptive semirigid body approximation", which is used to construct a physically 
reasonable initial guess of the minimum energy path structures for subsequent NEB/cNEB calculation.

Features
========

The ASBA method extracts the atomic radii from the average bond lengths from the initial and final
states and utilizes a semirigid-body force model and the NEB method to keep the majorly displaced 
atoms in close contact within the intermediate structures.
